This Dashboard demo aims to engage a broad audience of active individuals. It is an activity Dashboard which analyses activities using data from a GPX file. There are three components in total. A map with a trail on it which is drawn using latitude and longitude coordinates. Moreover, a data grid component which filters and calculates the average pace, elevation gain and heartrate over each split/kilometer. Lastly, a chart displays precise development of the respective variables. The final feature on the dashboard should be a dynamic tracker, in which movement along the chartâ€™s x-axis is synchronized with a GPS along the trail.
